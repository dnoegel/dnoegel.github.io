After accidentally ruining the glas bed of my Artillery Genius Pro I decided to install a spring steel sheet with PEI surface.

## What happened?
One sunny sunday I decided that my radiators need to be vented. And as the valve of some radiators are hard to reach, I wanted
to print special, small radiator keys, that fit into every niche.

Unfortunately I was printing in PETG - and for some reasons the first layer was closer to the bed than usual. So close that when 
removing the prints, I pealed of parts of the glas bed coating as well.

# The fix
I was thinking about replacing the glas bet e.g. with [aluminium one](https://www.abs-3d.de/druckbetten/druckbetten-nicht-magnetisch/artillery/626/artillery-genius-aluminium-druckbett)
but then I decided to just purchase a [magnetic plate](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001145949016.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.4b351802sSil3s) that could be glued onto the glas bed. That solution is cost-efficient,
easy to install and allows to remove the prints easily from the bed when finished.
